# TextBasedBrowser
Having the option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal can really come in handy. Let's use Python to create a text-based browser. In this project, you will create a simplified browser that will ignore JS and CSS, won't have cookies, and only will show a limited set of tags. But it will still be good enough for some situations, and building it will be fun!
In this project, you will learn how HTTP works and how to work with it in Python. You will become familiar with Python input and output. You will also need to parse HTML, so you'll get some experience with that, too.
